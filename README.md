Description: 

This is a text based adventure game that I have created for a college assignment.

This program works by presenting the user with a scenario, then giving them three options.
The user then selects an option, then the program converts their option into a choice variable
this variable then goes through an If statement that selects the response to that choice.

The program ends when either the player reaches the end of the story, or they die, the player
dies when they reach an option that results in their death.

Instalation:

To install this program, you will need to have Visual Studio installed on your computer.
Download the ZIP file available in this repository, then extract the file, you should then
be able to open the file using Visual Studio and run the program using the run button in
Visual Studio.
